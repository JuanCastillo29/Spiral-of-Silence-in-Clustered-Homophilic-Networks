# Spiral-of-Silence-in-Clustered-Homophilic-Network

## Abstract

Public discourse emerges from the interplay between individuals willingness to voice their opinions and the structural features of the social networks in which they are embedded. In this work, we investiate how choice homphily and triadic closure shape the emergence of the spiral of silence, the phenomenon whereby minority views are progressively silenced due to fear isolation. We advanced the state of the art in three ways. First, we integrate a realisitc network formation model, where homophily and triadic closure co-evolve, with a mean-field model of opinion expression. Second, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the associated Q-learning dynamics, revealing conditions for hysteresis cycles and path dependence in collective expression. Third, we validate our theoretical prediction through Monte Carlo simulatios, which highlight the role of fine-size effects and structural noise. Our results show that moderate triadic closure can foster minority expression by reinforcing local cohesion, whereas excesive closure amplifies assymetries and entreches majority dominance. These findings provide new insights into how algorithmic reinforcement of clustering in online platforms can either sustain diversity of opinion or accelerate its suppression.
